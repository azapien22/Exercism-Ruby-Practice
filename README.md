# Exercism-Ruby-Practice

**Learning Ruby is a lifelong journey. Advance your knowledge with weekly practice on the Exercism platform.**

Let’s exercise our newfound Ruby skills with Exercism.io, a wonderful non-profit project. It’s a community for leveling up programming skills through solving problems, discussion, and mentorship.

Sadly, the demand for Ruby mentorship overwhelmed the supply of mentors, so for the time being you may not receive timely code reviews; but 1) we can still review each other, and 2) the previous solutions and discussions about them are public and still incredibly useful for learning various ways to solve a problem with Ruby.

Furthermore, one of the most valuable things about Exercism is that it has the same problems in different languages. When it comes time to learn new languages (which you certainly will if you continue with software development), a great way to learn new syntaxes is to solve the same problems that you’ve already solved before in a familiar language.
